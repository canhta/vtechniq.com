    <p class='poppins'>
      Hi, I'm Canh, software engineer located in Hanoi, currently working as
      Technical Lead at <a
        href='https://seta-international.com/'
        class='underline'
        target='_blank'>Seta International</a
      >. My love for the web was first sparked in 2018 when I decided to build a
      simple HTML page to display the photos I took at the time, there was no
      way back! Since then and there, I was completely in love with building on
      and for the web.

    <p class='poppins mt-2'>
      Today, I'm mainly focussed on Full-Stack development with a love for
      front-end and JavaScript.
